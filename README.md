# 42 Common Core Projects
In this repository, you will find all the projects from the 42 Common Core (before the transition to the new Python-based core curriculum).
The projects are listed below, each with a brief description.

The 42 Common Core is divided into several milestones.
Each milestone includes multiple projects, and starting from Milestone 2, a mandatory exam must be passed at each stage until the final one.

### Disclaimer :
Some projects were optional choices within the Common Core. In those cases, students were given multiple options and had to choose one.
Projects marked with the 📃 emoji indicate that they were selected under this condition.

## Milestone 0
* Libft: A custom C library reimplementing standard functions, used as a foundation for future projects.
## Milestone 1
* ft_printf: Reimplementation of the printf function in C.
* get_next_line: Programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.
* Born2BeRoot: Creation and configuration of a virtual machine.
## Milestone 2
